# College Placement Cell Portal

The portal provides a centralized platform for students to manage their profiles, view and apply for job postings, and keep track of their application statuses. Meanwhile, the Training and Placement Officers (TPOs) can efficiently manage job postings, send notifications, and view consolidated data on student activity.

#### For Admins (TPO):

- **Notifications:** Send notifications to all students or specific groups regarding upcoming opportunities.
- **Consolidated Data:** View and analyze student application data in real-time for efficient tracking and reporting.
